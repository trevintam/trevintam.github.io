                        <p>Since 2010s, with the widespread use of social media, such as Facebook with more than 2 billion monthly activities globally, twitter with 300 million monthly activities, people have discovered the massive amount of data on social media can be used in a variety of business scenarios including stock price prediction. </p>

                        <p>According to  <a href="https://stockpulse.ai/">Stockpulse</a>, a NLP-powered emotional intelligence company, like most other industries, the financial industry communicates by sharing information and data via the Internet and, eventually, through social media. People interacting on social media generate emotional data by expressing their emotions and opinions via tweets, forum posts, and blogs.  They also consume it, and in the process are influenced by the sentiments, feelings, and opinions expressed by others. By monitoring and analysing data from social media sources, especially with regard to communication about stocks, it’s now possible to connect the dots between sentiment and market movements.  </p>

                        <p>At the same time, with the development of neural network, Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology has also been greatly developed in the past decade. Natural language processing (NLP) refers to the branch of computer science—and more specifically, the branch of artificial intelligence or AI—concerned with giving computers the ability to understand text and spoken words in much the same way human beings can. NLP has a wide variety of applications, for example it has become an essential business tool for uncovering hidden data insights from social media channels. Sentiment analysis can analyse language used in social media posts, responses, reviews, and more to extract attitudes and emotions in response to products, promotions, and events–information companies can use in product designs, advertising campaigns, and more.</p>

                        <p>Under the context of growing interest of using NLP to analyze massive social media data, when investors saw there was a massive amount of textual data on WallStreetBets and its strongly positive correlation of GME stock price, they were attracted to trade on WallStreetBets’ sentiment and comment frequency.</p>
                        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/9425517"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
                        <p>Chan recalled back in 2021, many bloggers have shared their program code on GitHub about sentiment analysis of comments on social media Reddit since GME short squeeze, where GitHub is an online software development platform enabling developers to share open-source code. To be specific, he had read one article titled as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/nmiq15/i_used_vader_sentiment_analysis_to_track_and/">“ I used sentiment analysis to track and invest based on WallStreetBets stock sentiment -- I'm up 33% annually $16k”</a>.</p>

                        <p>Referencing their high return of implementing the program, Chan was thrilled to join and clone the code to test the program. “In the first month of trading, I earned 50% YTD, much higher than S&P500’s return.” Even though the later months in 2021 did not perform as well as the first half year, the program seems all fine to him and he keeps use it occasionally to trade on that.</p>
                        <p>However, global markets including Nasdaq market has suffered its big losses in March as investors took fright at the escalation of the conflict in Ukraine following news such as a fire and Russian capture of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station. Capital flew from high risk stocks to the safe haven of the US dollar and the highest crude oil prices in a decade, but the model fail to predict the drop of stock price causing him to lose money in fortnight.</p>
