                        <h2 class="section-heading">Retail business heavily impacted by Covid-19</h2>
                        <p>Goldman Sachs Financial Analyst Lam Tsz-kwan warned if anyone still trading on these programs, they have to realize GME’s fundamental and financial situation. </p>
                        <p>GameStop Corp. (GME) is focused on offering games, entertainment products and technology through its e commerce properties and stores. “Since GME primarily does physical retail operations and digital products only account less than 3% of their business portfolio, this type of business has been seriously impacted by the Covid-19.” </p>
                        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/9425871"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
                        <p>Also he alerted relevant investors total retail store has dropped from 7276 to 4816 from 2018 to 2021, not to mention games are increasingly going digital. The pandemic has made the situation much worse as video game buyers pivoted hard toward digital downloads and buying games online.</p>
                        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/9426119"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Concerning profitability and bargaining power from suppliers and consumers</h2>
                        <p>“In terms of GME’s profitability, its revenue and profit margin have dropped substantially”, Lam warned. He explained profit margin indicates how many cents of profit GME’s retail business has generated for each dollar of sale. The declining profit margin of GME implies its business is become less and less profitable.</p>
                        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/9426343"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
                        <p>“Their days sales outstanding rise rapidly”, Lam stressed. He explained giants like Walmart and Amazon are selling similar stuff so GME could not receive descent business terms from suppliers and consumers in product return policies and payment terms, leading to rapid rise in days sales outstanding. He further explains days sales outstanding measure number of days that it takes GME to collect payment for a sale on average. GME’s increasing days sales outstanding number suggests that it is experiencing delays in receiving payments, causing a cash flow problem. </p>
                        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/9434404"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
                        <p> “In recent years GME’ days payable outstanding has decreased substantially, meaning it has been losing bargaining power from supply chain.” he also added. Contrary to days sales outstanding, he explained the decreasing number of days payable outstanding indicates the average time of GME takes to pay its bills to its trade creditors, suppliers or vendors has been shortening, meaning they have less bargaining power from their suppliers and becoming less flexible to manage their cash reserve.</p>
                        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/9434447"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
                        <p>“In terms of leverage, GME now rely heavily on debt to finance their operations.” Lam alerted us. He said now GME’s operations generate insufficient cash to pay back the debt and suffer from high interest, and its high debt ratio may signal the company is not having enough cash to finance their daily operations, which has high risk of go bankrupt.</p>

                        <br>

                            </div>
                        <p>Aqumon Head Of Corporate Communications Caroline York said Aqumon, whose belief is long-term investment, has not included social media data in its investment decision or algorithm. “Although there is a rise of social media data volume and NLP has become more mature, we strongly believe sentiment has little impact to companies’ value.” </p>
                        <p>She added that companies’ assets and competitiveness would be still there even if the public sentiment is poor, like Meta (named Facebook previously) has been surrounding negative comments in since 2010, but its stock price keeps increasing till 2021. </p>

                        <p>Contrary, if companies’ fundamentals are poor, stock price would go back to its fundamental finally. Recently, a remarkable example would be Warren Buffet and Catherine Wood’s portfolio return. She explained from 2020-2021 Wood’s portfolio return was much higher than Buffet’s, but in 2022, Buffet’s return converges with Wood's again.</p>
